# ltspice-circuits
A collection of circuits with models from CMOS and TTL logic to digital and analog components.

## To Do List

- [ ] add more samples
- [ ] add different type of analysis
- [ ] make compact models
- [ ] make the models run independently
- [ ] add some datasheet resources
- [ ] add some book resources

## Project Structure

Folder CMOS contains the circuits designed with CMOS transistors.

Folder BJT contains the same circuits with BJT transistor.

Folder Hybrid contains the same circuits with CMOS NOT gate and Memristive AND , OR gates.

Folder CMOS-like contains the same circuits with 1T1M ( 1 transistor 1 memristor ).

Folder Power contains some power electronics components.
